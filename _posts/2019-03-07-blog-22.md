    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered because I had to try many times to come close to picking up the pencil and I managed to make the arm elbow bend down enough but the gripper closed up too quickly to pick up the pencil.</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself to understand how I could make the gripper wait but only realised what to do at the end of the lesson.</td>
