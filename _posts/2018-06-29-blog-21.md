**What I have learnt this lesson**

I have learnt that you should always ask for someone's permission or consent before you take a picture of them even if it is in a public place or at least think would you want someone taking a picture of you if you were in the position they they are in or if you were doing something that they are doing.

I have also learnt that it is illegal to take pictures of people that are under the age of 18 that are naked or that it is illegal to take a picture of someone if they not in a public place without their permission.
